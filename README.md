# AWS-Resource-Tracker-
AWS Resource Tracker is a Bash script that monitors AWS resources such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users. The script retrieves real-time information using AWS CLI and formats the output for easy tracking. A cron job is set up to automate the script execution daily at 20:00 (8:00 PM).
